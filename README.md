# Daily-challenge
This is a compilation of problem I solved with solution.
The problem title is the filename and every word problem is inside the specific file.
Feel free to pull a request if you have a better solution than to an existing one, this is an open repo so everyone can collaborate and practice on their own.

The problem inside the C directory contains the C codes with some doesn't have a problem question but only the 'problem code' in it's file name which you can search in the web for the actual problem.
